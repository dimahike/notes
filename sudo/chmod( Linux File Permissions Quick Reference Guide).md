### Linux File Permissions Quick Reference Guide

**Understanding File Permissions:**

- **Permissions**: Determines what actions users can perform on a file/directory (e.g., read, write, execute).
- **Users**: Permissions are defined for three types of users:
  - **Owner**: The file's creator or designated owner.
  - **Group**: Members of the file's assigned group.
  - **Others**: All other users not classified as owner or group.

**Permission Types:**

- **Read (r)**: Permission to view the contents of the file/directory.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file/directory.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to run the file as a program or access a directory.

**Octal Permission Notation:**

- Composed of three digits, each ranging from 0 to 7.
- Each digit represents the permissions for the Owner, Group, and Others, in that order.
- The value of each digit is the sum of its component permissions: Read (4), Write (2), Execute (1).

| Octal Value | Permissions | Description                    |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 0           | ---         | No permissions                 |
| 1           | --x         | Execute only                   |
| 2           | -w-         | Write only                     |
| 3           | -wx         | Write and execute              |
| 4           | r--         | Read only                      |
| 5           | r-x         | Read and execute               |
| 6           | rw-         | Read and write                 |
| 7           | rwx         | Read, write, and execute       |

**Common Permission Settings:**

- `700` (rwx------): Owner can read, write, execute; Group and Others have no permissions.
- `755` (rwxr-xr-x): Owner can read, write, execute; Group and Others can read and execute.
- `644` (rw-r--r--): Owner can read and write; Group and Others can read only.

**Using `chmod` Command:**

- **Syntax**: `chmod [options] mode file/directory`
- **Options**: `-R` for recursive change (applies to directories and their contents).

**Examples:**

1. **Set Owner Read/Write (600)**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 filename
   ```
   Owner can read/write; Group/Others have no access.

2. **Add Execute Permission for Owner (744)**:
   ```bash
   chmod 744 filename
   ```
   Owner can read/write/execute; Group/Others can read only.

3. **Make a File Readable by Everyone (644)**:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 filename
   ```
   Owner can read/write; Group/Others can read.

4. **Recursive Permission Change (755 for Directories/Files)**:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 directory_name
   ```
   Sets directories/files inside to be accessible by Owner fully; Group/Others can read/execute.

5. **Using Symbolic Mode (Add Execute for Group/Others)**:
   ```bash
   chmod go+x filename
   ```
The symbolic notation `go+x` used with the `chmod` command modifies the permissions of a file or directory in a more intuitive way than using octal numbers. Here's a breakdown of what `go+x` means:

- `g`: Stands for "group." It refers to the user group that has ownership of the file, apart from the owner themselves.
- `o`: Stands for "others." This represents all users on the system who are not the owner of the file and not part of the file's group.
- `+`: This symbol indicates that you are adding a permission.
- `x`: Stands for "execute." This permission allows users to run a file as a program or script. For directories, execute permission allows users to enter the directory and access files or directories inside.

You are adding execute permission (`x`) to both the group (`g`) and others (`o`) for the specified file (`filename`). This means:

- **Group members** and **other users** on the system will now have the ability to execute the file as a program if it's a script or a binary executable. If `filename` is a directory, they will gain the ability to enter this directory and access its contents.

This command does not change the existing read or write permissions for the group and others, nor does it alter the owner's permissions in any way. It simply adds execute permission where it was not previously set for group and others.

**Tips:**

- Use `ls -l` to view the current permissions of files/directories.
- For sensitive files (e.g., configuration files), restrict access to Owner only (e.g., `chmod 600 config.txt`).
- Always consider security implications when setting permissions, especially on a multi-user system or web server.
